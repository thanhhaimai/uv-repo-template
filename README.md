# uv-repo-template

A template repo with most common python tooling setup (uv, pre-commit, ruff, pytest,...)

## Setup

- [ ] Manual install `brew` -- <https://brew.sh/>

- [ ] Run `setup/setup.sh` for one time setup. The script is idempotent, so it's okay to re-run if the setup changes.

## Keep up to date

Ruff

- Check and update `rev` field in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the desired version
